homework week 1

Unfortunately i did not completed section 2. I added an external stylesheet from part 3.
I know, not the most difficult assignment of part 3.
I tried to make the image clickable on the right way, but somehow it kept returning an error, which I could not resolve.
I spend more then the 8 hours, I just want to do this. Need to set my priorities better.

Last I want to add that I've become ill since last friday with a stomagflue. Thanks to my little daughter's first week at daycare.
So concidering my health, I might not complane that I did almost whole section 2.
Now I'm going to bed again, hopefully to be better tomorrow
Really enjoying the course, and it really sucks to be sick the first week. I'm never sick:S.
See you tomorrow.
